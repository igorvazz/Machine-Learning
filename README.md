# Machine-Learning

Here I share some Datasets analysis where I applied different algorithms, tools and concepts such as:

**Classification**:

* Logistic Regression
* SVM
* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

**Regression**:

* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* SVR

**Performance Metrics**:

* R2 score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve
* Precision vs Recall
* F1 Score

and techniques such as K-Fold Cross Validation and Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation
